# Biodiversity_portfolio
    This project cleans and examines data pertaining to species having conservation statuses that require monitoring. The aim is to look for any patterns or trends among species that could point to some reasoning behind the conservation status.

    The cleaning of data and construction of graphs is done within the jupyter notebook. The data used is stored in two csv files. And the final conclusions and graphs are in the powerpoint document.
